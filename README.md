# Speech_MRI
**Synopsis**

Real-time MRI provides the ability to visualize dynamic processes as they occur. This may require low latency, defined as the total time between when a pose occurs and when a digital representation appears on a screen for interpretation and/or use by the scan operator. We explore the tradeoff between image quality and latency for speech production imaging, where high-latency constrained reconstruction is the current state-of-the-art. We demonstrate that image quality adequate for a) confirmation of stimuli compliance and b) identification of subject motion can be provided to the scan operator with a latency less than 70ms.
